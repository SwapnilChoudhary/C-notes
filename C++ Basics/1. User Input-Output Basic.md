1. ` #include<iostream> ` always needed in C++ syntax as it is the standard library of C++ of input output stream.
2. ` #include<math.h> ` this library includes all math function in itself so we need to include it in our code to use it's function.
3. ` #include<bits/stdc++.h> ` this is the father library which includes all C++ libraries simultaneously.
4. ` using namespace std; `  with the help of this line we don't need to include std to use cout, cin, endl or /n etc.
5. ` int x `  it is the variable x which defined as integer data type.  [[2. Data Types Basic]] 
6. ` cin >> x; ` cin used to take input from user to this int variable x .
7. ` cout << " Value of x: " << x; ` cout used to print output on the computer screen and it uses this (<<) operator to print the value of x and this ("") syntax helps to write any text within itself and make it print as it is on computer screen.
8. ` // any comment can be written with backslash ` for single line comments in C++.
9. ` /* any comment can be written here as long as paragraph */ ` backslash before and after asterisk used in C++ for multi-line comments.
