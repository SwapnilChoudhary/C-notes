1. Example -> While
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int i = 1;
	while(i<=5) {
		cout << "Striver " << i << endl;
		i = i+ 1;
	}
	cout << i;
	return 0;
}
```
In While Loop, we have to initialize the variable before the function and then with function we have to define the condition in which the loop execute and after that we have to increment in the variable, so the loop will stop otherwise it will run for infinity as the condition will never become false.

2. Example -> Do-While
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int i = 2;
	do{
		cout <<  "Striver " << i << endl;
		i = i + 1;
	} while(i<=1);
	cout << i << endl;

	return 0;
}
```
In Do-While Loop, 'do' function executes the code at least one time then checks the while condition if it is true or false.
