1. Example
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*
Take the day no and print the corresponding day
for 1 print Monday,
for 2 print Tuesday and so on for 7 print Sunday.
*/
int main() {
	int day;
	cin >> day;

	switch(day) {
		case 1:
			cout << "Monday";
			break;
		case 2: 
			cout << "Tuesday";
			break;
		case 3: 
			cout << "Wednesday";
			break;
		case 4:
			cout << "Thursday";
			break;
		case 5:
			cout << "Friday";
			break;
		case 6:
			cout << "Saturday";
			break;
		case 7: 
			cout << "Sunday";
			break;
		default:
			cout << "Invalid";
			break;	
	}
		cout << endl << "Break is working in switch case statement !";
	return 0;
}

```
Here we're using switch-case statement and In this example we're using break after each case as the we've to come out of the condition statement so it doesn't not include other cases and gets executed accurately. We use default in the end after all cases so we can determine that only desired output get print and other output should be invalid input.
