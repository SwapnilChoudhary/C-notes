1. Example 
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
// Write a program that takes an input of age
// and prints if you are adult or not
// >= 18, yes
// < 18, no
int main() {
	int age;
	cin >> age;
	if (age >= 18) {
		cout << "You are an adult!";
	}
	// here I can include "else if (age<18){---}" also after "else {---}"
	else {
	cout << "You are not an adult!";
	}
	return 0;
}
```
This is an example of If-else statement but else-if also defined here in comments.
else-if condition is different from if-if-else condition because In else-if , else only be executed when the condition of if 'just after else' gets satisfied.

2. Example
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*
A school has following rules for grading system:
a. Below 25 - F
b. 25 to 44 - E
c. 45 to 49 - D
d. 50 to 59 - C
e. 60 to 79 - B
f. 80 to 79 - A
Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.
*/
int main() {
	int marks;
	cin >> marks;
	if(marks >= 0 && marks < 25) {
		cout << "F";
	}
	// using else-if condition to reduce time complexity
	else if(marks <= 44) {
		cout << "E";
	}
	else if(marks <= 49) {
		cout << "D";
	}
	else if(marks <= 59) {
		cout << "C";
	}
	else if(marks <= 79) {
		cout << "B";
	}
	else if(marks <= 100) {
		cout << "A";
	}
	else  {
	    cout << "Marks above 100 or below zero are not valid !";
	}
	return 0;
}
```
In this example, we're using multiple else-if conditions because we need to only check that
number which were taken as input.

3.  
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*
Take the age from the user and then decide accordingly
1. If age < 18,
	print-> not eligible for job
2. If age >= 18 and age <= 54,
	print-> "eligible for job"
3. If age >= 55 and age <= 57,
	print-> "eligible for job, but retirement soon."
4. If age > 57
	print-> "retirement time"
*/
int main() {
	int age;
	cin >> age;
	if(age < 18) {
		cout << "not eligible for job";
	}
	// >= 18
	else if(age <= 57) {
		cout << "eligible for job";
		// nested if condition
		if(age >= 55) {
		cout << ", but retirement soon";
		}
	}
	else {
		cout << "retirement time";
	}
	return 0;
}
```
This example shows that we can use if conditions also inside of else-if conditions which is known as nested if-else statements.
we can use if-else statements inside of if-else statements but not safe to use much.
