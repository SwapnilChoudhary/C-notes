C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. This C++ Tutorial will cover all the basic to advanced topics of C++ like C++ basics, C++ functions, C++ classes, OOPs and STL concepts.
C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.
C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.
It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs and providing security.
It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
C++ is easy to learn so that you can choose it as your first programming language.
It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.
